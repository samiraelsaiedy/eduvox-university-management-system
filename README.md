🎓 EduVox - AI-Powered University Management System

🌟 Revolutionizing Education for Visually Impaired Students
An innovative university management system designed specifically for blind students, featuring voice commands, AI-powered text summarization, and advanced speech recognition.

🚀 Introduction
Our University Management System, designed specifically for blind students, is a game-changer in accessible education. With voice commands and advanced speech recognition, students can navigate effortlessly—no need for screens or keyboards.
The system features a sleek interface built on cutting-edge AI Models for summarizing PDFs, making learning materials easy to digest. It's not just for students; instructors and directors get robust tools for managing courses and programs, making it a comprehensive solution for an inclusive academic experience.

🤖 AI Technologies Used
1. Transformer-based NLP for Text Summarization
Model: facebook/bart-large-cnn

BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) is a transformer model trained for text generation tasks, including summarization
The model operates as an encoder-decoder transformer, first encoding the text into latent representations and then decoding it into a summarized form

Key AI Concepts Used:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Handles text extraction and summarization
Transformer Architecture: BART applies bidirectional training and auto-regressive decoding
Sequence-to-Sequence Learning: Converts full-text input into a shorter, meaningful summary

2. AI Workflow Summary
Text Summarization Process:
Extract text → Tokenize → Generate Summary using Transformer → Decode Output
Mathematical Equation Processing:
Extract images from PDF → OCR using Deep Learning → Convert to LaTeX → 
Convert to structured symbolic math → Generate Speech Output
